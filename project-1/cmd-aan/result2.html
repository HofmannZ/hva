                <p>
                    With a population of over 811,000 (iAmsterdam, 2014), Amsterdam
                    is not only the capital city but also the most populous city in the
                    Netherlands. Amsterdam is governed by an elected council that is
                    seated in The Music Theatre/Stopera. The building houses both the
                    city hall (stadhuis) and the Dutch Opera. The mayor, appointed by
                    the national government, has autonomous powers. The aldermen
                    are elected by and from the city council. The decentralisation of
                    the city’s administration in 1990 meant that many civic tasks
                    and powers were delegated to the city districts. One aim of this
                    operation was to increase public participation at local level, by
                    enabling citizens to elect representatives to both their local district
                    council and the city council. However, at the moment centralisation
                    is slowly gaining ground again.

               <h3>Crime and the Law</h3>
               <p>
                    Everybody aged fourteen and over must be able to show a valid
                    identity card (id) or passport if the police or anybody else with the
                    authority such as conductors in public transport asks for it. They
                    need to have a reason to ask for it, such as traffic control, aid and assistance,
                    penal offences, or maintaining law and order. There won’t
                    be any special check-ups just to see if you have it on you. If you
                    cannot show a valid identity card or passport on request, you can
                    be taken to the police station where your identity will be checked. If
                    you are sixteen or older, you will be fined e90 for not having your
                    papers on you. Amsterdam is a great city to live in, but like any
                    large city it has risks and dangers that you should be aware of.   
               </p>
               <h3>Legal Assistance </h3>
               <p>
                    If you get involved in some kind of legal conflict during your stay
                    in the Netherlands, you might need legal assistance. Everyone is
                    entitled to legal representation by law. Those who can’t afford a
                    lawyer can go to a legal advice centre (check the address below) or
                    solicitor’s office, where first consultations are given free of charge.    
               </p> 
               <h3>City Districts </h3>
               <p>
                    The city districts (stadsdelen) of Amsterdam are administrative
                    areas, distinct from neighbourhoods or quarters. A city district is
                    larger than a neighbourhood or quarter and has a local council,
                    elected by the district’s inhabitants. It also has a separate municipal
                    administration and can draw up its own budget. Amsterdam’s city
                    districts are:    
                    <ul class="citys">
                        <li>Centrum (Centre)</li>
