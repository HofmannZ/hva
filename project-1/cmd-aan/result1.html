                <p>
                    The Netherlands has a population of almost 17 million people.
                    By car it will take you only four hours to drive from north to south.
                    The country is bordered by Belgium, Germany and the North Sea.
                    Amsterdam is the capital city of the Netherlands and the government
                    is seated in The Hague.

                <p>
                   The Western and Northern parts of the country lie between one
                    and six metres below sea level. The soil here is mostly peat and
                    clay, cut through with canals, rivers and estuaries. Much of the
                    land is used for farming or grazing. The territories below sea level
                    used to be lakes or belong to the sea. Mills and pumping stations
                    are used to drain them. The pumping stations run constantly to
                    prevent flooding. Furthermore, the coastal areas are protected by 
                    the netherlands 13
                    natural dunes as well as by man-made dikes. The Flevopolder and
                    the Noordoostpolder are the two polders most recently reclaimed
                    from the sea in the never-ending battle against the water. After the
                    reclamation the land was divided into lots. In 1953, the southern
                    province of Zeeland was hit by a disastrous flood. In the decades
                    following this flood the Delta Works were constructed to straighten
                    and strengthen the southern shoreline with new dikes, dams,
                    sluices and bridges.

                <p>
                   The Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces, each with their own capital.

                <h3>Climate</h3>
                <p>
                   The Netherlands has a maritime climate. It rains a lot and there are
                    only moderate variations in temperature between the four seasons.
                    July and August are at one end of the scale, with average temperatures
                    between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius. The winter months are
                    at the other end of the scale, with frost and sometimes snow.
