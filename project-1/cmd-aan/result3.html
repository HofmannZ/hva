                    Amsterdam has a sizeable student population. Together, the
                    UvA (University of Amsterdam) and VU University Amsterdam
                    have over 50,000 students. The Universities of Applied Sciences
                    (hogescholen or hbo) combined have approximately 55,000
                    students. Economics is the most popular course for the hogescholen,
                    while Behavioural and Social Sciences attract the most students at
                    the Amsterdam UvA and VU Universities.

               <h3>Higher Education </h3>
               <p>
                    There are two types of higher education institutions in the
                    Netherlands, Universities and Universities of Applied Sciences
                    (hogescholen or hbo). Hogescholen prepare students for specific
                    professions and tend to be more practically oriented than universities,
                    which focus more on theory and generating knowledge
                    through research. Generally speaking, an hbo degree provides its
                    graduates with sufficient skills to practise the profession they were
                    trained for, without any additional training    
               </p>
               <h3>Bachelor – Master</h3>
               <p>
                    In the last decade, the system of higher education has been drastically
                    reorganised to comply with the British or American model.
                    This means that a university education has been subdivided into
                    a broader, three-year bachelor’s degree and a one-year master’s
                    degree. At hogescholen the bachelor’s degree takes four years while
                    in some cases graduates will be able to continue their studies for
                    one or two years for a master’s degree. The aim of this European
                    reorganisation is to make the system of higher education more
                    transparent throughout Europe and to make it easier to study in
                    another country.
