Code related to my education at the Amsterdam University of Applied Science( HvA.)


## Project 1 (individual) - English site
Project 1 was an individual assignment. It's main goal was to find a new way to digitalize the International Students Guide Amsterdam( ISGA.) Base on a target group analysis I chose to display the timeline chapters as the main feature of the digital ISGA. The timeline feature uses a javascript clock wich fetches data from the Firebase database bassed on the current time. All the code had to be hand written, including any logic that runs in the background.

#### Main features:
* Timeline fetched from database
* Responsive layout
* Custom Google Maps
My final grade
