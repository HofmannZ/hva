Code related to my education at the Amsterdam University of Applied Science(HvA.)


## Project 1 (individual) - English
Project 1 was an individual assignment. It's main goal was to find a new way to digitalize the International Students Guide Amsterdam(ISGA.) Base on a target group analysis I chose to display the timeline chapters as the main feature of the digital ISGA. The timeline feature uses a JavaScript clock which fetches data from the Firebase database based on the current time. All the code had to be hand written, including any logic that runs in the background.

#### Main features:
* Timeline fetched from database
* Responsive layout
* Custom Google Maps

My final grade
* Code: A+
* UX: B

## Introduction to Programming (individual) - English
This is a small project for the course Introduction to Programming at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. This project is slightly more advanced what is required by the course.

With this this project I honed my skills in React.js and learned the basics of Meteor.js

#### Main features:
* Real-time data
* Component based
* JavaScript only file upload and storage
